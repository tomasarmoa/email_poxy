"""Extend this class to create Email OAuth 2.0 Proxy plugins that customise IMAP/POP/SMTP client/server behaviour. The
two overridable methods `receive_from_client` and `receive_from_server` give access to raw IMAP/POP/SMTP messages and/or
commands as they are received. The return values from the overridden methods and the two sender methods `send_to_server`
and `send_to_client` allow you to send messages/commands to the client/server (and other chained plugins) in response.
The `log_debug`, `log_info` and `log_error` methods allow you to post messages to the proxy's main log. When developing
plugins, it is important to note that on the client side, plugins are only inserted after authentication has finished
(in order to prevent any interference with authentication). As a result, you will not receive any messages from the
client until that process is complete."""
